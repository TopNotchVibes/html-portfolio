<h1>The Top 3 Movies according to Me</h1>
<h2>By TNV</h2>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>An unbelievable first film for director Frank Darabount.  This is ba far the best film based on a Stephen King story.  The acting is top notch, and Roger Deakins' cinematography is unreal.  Composer Thomas Newman turns in one of the most iconic scores of all time.</p>
<h3>There Will Be Blood</h3>
<p>In the same year as the Coens make one of their best films with one of the greatest film performances, their opus is in my opinions completely overshadowed by this masterpiece from Paul Thomas Anderson.  Daniel Day Lewis reminds everyone he is the greatest of all time by disappearing into his role as both protagonist and villain.  </p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>I'm not sure this is actually on my top 3 but it's close, but I really need to not let this little demo project slow me down.</p>
